## State design pattern (on traffic light example)

This project implements the State design pattern for a traffic light simulation. The project has the following files:

- `src/TrafficLight.hpp`: Header file for the `TrafficLight` class that represents the traffic light object.
- `src/States.hpp`: Header file that defines the various states of the traffic light and the `StateInterface` class that they implement.
- `src/main.cpp`: Source file that contains the `main` function for running the traffic light simulation.
- `test/test.cpp`: Source file that contains unit tests for the project.

Automatic tests for each push are also configured.
